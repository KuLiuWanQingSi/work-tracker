This directory is for browser extension (or user scripts to be specific) supports that is not actually a part
of the main application. These scripts provide readonly access to database created and maintained by the main
application, with an entrypoint that is should be loaded by Violentmonkey which evaluates all webpages opened,
checks if the url matches anyone predefined by the user, and load the script from the url specified alongside
by the user by attaching it into the webpage and initialize it with the decrypted database.
