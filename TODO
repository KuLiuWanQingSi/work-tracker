[UI] Improve import bottom dialog
  The dialog is now too tight
  The progress bar does not give accurate indication about the real progress: long wait time after the
   progress bar has already reached the end

[Maintenance] Clearup translation keys
  The key structure is now totally chaos

[functionality] Database maintenance
  Statistics view about the database
  Tag summary about the database
  Tag renaming support
  Tag merging support: multiple tags may be (accidentally) used to mark the same thing, merging allows to
   remove such duplication by unifying them with a single tag
  Tag aliasing: like merging but with long-term effect that if B is set as an alias to A, any instances of B
   created later will be automatically and silently transformed into A. This eases the conversion between
   different tags used to describe the same thing from different sources
  Tag subclass: some tags, can A and B, can be indeed different, but A can always implicates B. Allow items
   only tagged with A to be matched by searching B and forbid B from being added to items already tagged
   with A
